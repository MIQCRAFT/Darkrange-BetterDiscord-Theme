# Installing
### BetterDiscord
If you're one of the few people who use BetterDiscord, please download [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexFlipnote/Discord_Theme/master/autotheme.theme.css) and import it to your client.

### Windows
I know that not everyone understands how to use commands,
so I have made a nice [installer](https://github.com/AlexFlipnote/beautifuldiscord-installer/raw/master/beautifuldiscord.exe)

If you're sceptical of what the .exe includes, don't hesitate to visit
[the source code of the installer](https://github.com/AlexFlipnote/beautifuldiscord-installer)
to verify that this installer is 100% safe.

**Note:** If you have any other clients installed (BetterDiscord, Powercord, etc), chances are that this installer will break your Discord. Keep that in mind before you take usage.

### Windows, Linux & Mac
If you know how to do commands and want to do it manually, follow this:
- https://github.com/DTinker/discord-resources/wiki/Installing-Modifications

### Chrome
You can install a Chrome plugin to have the theme directly implemented for you.<br>

# FAQ
**What should I use, theme.css or autotheme.css?**<br>That really depends on you. If you are a developer and want
to change stuff, download the **theme.css**, however if you wish for a theme that updates, use **autotheme.css**

**How do I use plugins?**<br>Read the [Documentation](https://github.com/AlexFlipnote/Discord_Theme/blob/master/docs/Documentation.md), then get some plugins [here](https://github.com/AlexFlipnote/Discord_Theme/blob/master/docs/Plugins.md)

**I found a bug, what do I do?**<br>Make a **Pull Request / Issue** and tell me :)
